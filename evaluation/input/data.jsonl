ESSENCE KERNEL\nEssence kernel contains essential elements that should be addressed in every software engineering endeavor. The kernel elements have 3 categories: alphas, activity spaces and competencies [3]. As shown in Figure 2, there are 7 alphas (Figure 2A)—stakeholder, opportunity, requirements, software system, work, way of working and team—and 15 activity spaces (2B) and 6 competencies (2C). Alphas, activity spaces and competencies are grouped in 3 areas of concern: customer, solution and endeavor.\n## 3.1 Essence Alpha and State Checklist\nAlphas are manifested by work products. Each alpha has a set of states. As shown in Figure 3, the opportunity alpha may be in one of six states over the lifecycle of a software engineering endeavor. If, for example, Product Vision—a work product in Scrum practice—is mapped to the opportunity alpha, Product Vision is deemed to go through the states listed in Figure 3. Essence also provides a checklist for each alpha state as illustrated in Figure 3. Cards can be used to recall the kernel elements. Figure 3 shows two types of cards—alpha definition card and alpha state detail card. Note that the checklist in an alpha state detail card shows an abbreviated version of the full checklist specified in [3].\n## 3.2 Essence Activity Space and Goal State\nActivity spaces are realized by one or more activities in a practice. Each activity may create or update one or more work products. For example, the understand the requirements activity space could be viewed as being realized by the release planning activity when using Scrum practice. Release planning produces a product backlog (work product), and this could be viewed as a manifest of the requirements alpha.\nActivities within a given activity space in an area of concern changes the states of some alphas in the same area. Figure 4 shows, based on Essence 1.0 [3], the alpha states that should typically be achieved by each activity space. We will call them the goal states of an activity space. For instance, the goal states of the explore possibilities activity space include: stakeholder::recognized, opportunity::identified, opportunity::solution needed, and opportunity::value established. The goal states of an activity can be determined as a subset of the goal states of the activity spaces in which the activity is contained.\nWe can observe in Figure 4 that an activity space sometimes transforms an alpha to a new state over one or more intermediate states: e.g., the understand the requirements activity space transforms the requirements alpha from a null state to the coherent state through two intermediate states: conceived and bounded. When an activity space drives an alpha to go through multiple states, the checklist to verify achievement of the activity space’s goal states should cumulatively contain all the checkpoints corresponding to those multiple states. The activity space checklist to verify achievement of the entire goal states of an activity space is obtained by the union of the checklist for every alpha affected by the activity space.\nIt should be noted that the activity space-alpha state relationships suggested in Essence 1.0 [3] (and shown in Figure 4) should be regarded as just a guideline. They will need to be tailored to address specific project situations. The Essence specification itself will evolve over coming years. The systematic procedure presented in Section 4 for describing a practice based on the Essence kernel is, however, still valid independent of any change to the activity space-alpha state relationships and alpha state checklists.","# Essence Kernel Alphas  \nThe Essence Kernel defines seven core, common Alphas for software engineering, which together:  \nCapture the key concepts involved in software engineering\nAllow the progress and health of any software endeavor to be tracked and assessed\nProvide common ground for the definition of software engineering practices.  \nNote that the Kernel Alphas each belong in one of the three Areas of Concern and are color-coded accordingly.","# Alpha State Cards  \nThis a list of all the Essence Kernel Alpha cards.  \nEach card has:\n- a title\n- a brief description (optional)\n- a list of states (optional)\n- a state (optional)\n- a checklist (optional)"],"answer":"The 7 Alphas of the Essence Kernel are:\n\n1.

Specialist Practices can extend this core minimum set by introducing their own additional Competencies as needed for particular types of endeavor to address specific types of challenge, such as Operations, Coaching, Database Administration or Hardware Design for example.  \n## Essence Kernel Competency Levels  \nThe Essence Kernel defines five standard Competency Levels that can be used across all Competencies as follows:  \nAssists - demonstrates a basic understanding of the concepts involved and can follow instructions\nApplies - able to apply the concepts in simple contexts by routinely applying the experience gained so far\nMasters - able to apply the concepts in most contexts and has the experience to work without supervision\nAdapts - able to apply judgment on when and how to apply the concepts to more complex contexts.

First articulated by Norman Kerth in his book, Project Retrospectives: A Handbook for Team Reviews [ 1], the Prime Directive is designed to set the stage for the retrospective:\nRegardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time,\ntheir skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand.\nThis principle is read aloud at the beginning of a retrospective, precisely in this wording.\nThe idea is to make it clear to everyone that we are all human and make mistakes. The principle also points out that we shouldn’t assume that things have been done badly deliberately.\n**Practical Tip**\nYou don’t need to read out the Prime Directive at every retrospective. In later retrospectives, simply reminding people of it is enough.\nMany retrospective facilitators swear by the Prime Directive. They feel that retrospectives that don’t start with this fundamental principle are less effective and therefore less useful. Pat Kua writes [Kua 2012] that this is related to the Pygmalion [ 11] or Rosenthal effect, or what is commonly known as “ ‘a self-fulfilling prophecy.’ ”\nThe effect of a teacher’s preconceptions about his students might be an example of the Rosenthal effect. The idea is that a teacher’s positive preconception about a student (‘that student is a high achiever’) will affect the teacher’s behavior in such a way as to create confirmation of his expectations. What happens is that the teacher subtly transmits his preconception to the student through, for example, more one-to-one attention, more time given for response, frequency and strength of praise or blame, or high-performance requirements. This is an unconscious rather than deliberate course of action.\nIn essence, the theory is that someone who is treated as having certain characteristics will manifest them. In fact, Rosenthal’s results were repeatedly called into question and could only be reproduced in 40 percent of cases [ 11].\nI personally believe that the success of a retrospective depends not on the careful reading out of the Prime Directive, but rather upon the values that it describes. I have carried out many successful retrospectives during which I did not explicitly mention the Prime Directive. I’m not saying that reading the\nprinciple isn’t a good thing; in new teams or established teams that are about to experience their first retrospective, this ritual can have a very positive, if not measurable, effect. In my experience, however, you lose that positive effect if you read out the directive at every retrospective. Repetition does to the directive what frequent flying does to pre-flight safety briefings. The first time you fly, you pay close attention. However, with prolonged exposure, you pay less and less attention until, in the end, you hardly notice it’s happening.\nA positive attitude is essential for a successful retrospective, but I believe there are many ways to achieve that attitude and the Prime Directive is only one (and one that is certainly no guarantee of success).\nThere is also an alternative prime directive that is somewhat longer but may work better for some teams [ 12].

The idea behind Progress Poker is simple. Individual Alphas are presented for assessment. After a period of discussion, each participant chooses from his or her own deck the numbered card that represents his or her estimate of the state that the Alpha is currently in. All estimates are kept private until each participant has chosen a card. At that time, all estimates are revealed and discussion can begin again.\nUse this game to determine the state of any particular Alpha.\n## Variations\nThe game can also be played with only one set of cards:\n1) Lay the state cards for the Alpha under consideration out on the table, in order, in front of the players.\n2) Each player considers the set of states and identifies the state that they believe the Alpha to be in.\n3) The players then simultaneously raise their hands with the correct number of fingers raised to indicate the state they have selected. A closed fist is used to indicate the sixth state.\n4) If all players have selected the same state card then there is consensus.\n5) If the selected cards are different then the players with the least and most advanced states explain their reasoning.\n6) Repeat from 3 until consensus emerges\nOr without the cards at all. As for the previous variation but in this case each player has a copy of the Reference Guide to consult when identifying the appropriate state.\n## Number of Players\nAny, but typically teams of 3 to 9 will be the most effective.\n## Equipment Needed\n- Essential: 1 set of Alpha State Cards for each player\n- Optional: An Alpha State Card Reference Guide\n## Duration of Play\n2 – 10 minutes.\n## How to Play\n1. Each player is given a set of state cards for the Alpha under consideration.\n2. The Alpha card for the Alpha under consideration is placed in the center of the table.\n3. Each player selects the state card that he or she thinks best represents the current state of the Alpha.\n4. All members put their selected state card face down on the table.\n5. When all are ready, they turn the state card face up.\nIf all players have selected the same state card then there is consensus.\n7. If the selected cards are different then the players with the least and most advanced states explain their reasoning.\n8. Repeat from 3 until consensus emerges\nOptional step: @ state 6 then the players might want to consider the full checklists found in the Reference Guide.\n## Strategy\nProgress Poker is a good way to come to a consensus without spending too much time on any one topic. It allows, or forces, people to voice their opinions, thoughts and concerns. Pick the Alphas of concern to the group and focus on them. This game can be used in conjunction with “Chase the State” to determine the overall state of any software development effort.

First articulated by Norman Kerth in his book, Project Retrospectives: A Handbook for Team Reviews [ 1], the Prime Directive is designed to set the stage for the retrospective:\nRegardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time,\ntheir skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand.\nThis principle is read aloud at the beginning of a retrospective, precisely in this wording.\nThe idea is to make it clear to everyone that we are all human and make mistakes. The principle also points out that we shouldn’t assume that things have been done badly deliberately.\n**Practical Tip**\nYou don’t need to read out the Prime Directive at every retrospective. In later retrospectives, simply reminding people of it is enough.\nMany retrospective facilitators swear by the Prime Directive. They feel that retrospectives that don’t start with this fundamental principle are less effective and therefore less useful. Pat Kua writes [Kua 2012] that this is related to the Pygmalion [ 11] or Rosenthal effect, or what is commonly known as “ ‘a self-fulfilling prophecy.’ ”\nThe effect of a teacher’s preconceptions about his students might be an example of the Rosenthal effect. The idea is that a teacher’s positive preconception about a student (‘that student is a high achiever’) will affect the teacher’s behavior in such a way as to create confirmation of his expectations. What happens is that the teacher subtly transmits his preconception to the student through, for example, more one-to-one attention, more time given for response, frequency and strength of praise or blame, or high-performance requirements. This is an unconscious rather than deliberate course of action.\nIn essence, the theory is that someone who is treated as having certain characteristics will manifest them. In fact, Rosenthal’s results were repeatedly called into question and could only be reproduced in 40 percent of cases [ 11].\nI personally believe that the success of a retrospective depends not on the careful reading out of the Prime Directive, but rather upon the values that it describes. I have carried out many successful retrospectives during which I did not explicitly mention the Prime Directive. I’m not saying that reading the\nprinciple isn’t a good thing; in new teams or established teams that are about to experience their first retrospective, this ritual can have a very positive, if not measurable, effect. In my experience, however, you lose that positive effect if you read out the directive at every retrospective. Repetition does to the directive what frequent flying does to pre-flight safety briefings. The first time you fly, you pay close attention. However, with prolonged exposure, you pay less and less attention until, in the end, you hardly notice it’s happening.\nA positive attitude is essential for a successful retrospective, but I believe there are many ways to achieve that attitude and the Prime Directive is only one (and one that is certainly no guarantee of success).\nThere is also an alternative prime directive that is somewhat longer but may work better for some teams [ 12]. I personally like the fact that it is written in the first person and is thus more appealing:\nSome days are better than others. Some days I’m in the “flow” state, doing awesome work. Some days I come to the end of a day and realized I’ve wasted a lot of time, made mistakes that I should have foreseen, or wish I could have done something differently.\nRegardless, those days have happened and our purpose here is to find out:\nWhat can we learn from our past actions and thinking that will inform and guide our future actions and thinking so that we can do a little better?\nHow can we change our environment (“the system”) so that it’s easier for us to do awesome work and less likely for us for us to waste time and make mistakes?\nLike the original Prime Directive, this version describes the goal of a retrospective and articulates the underlying principles. Also like the original, this alternative is just a tool and does not guarantee a successful retrospective. My advice is that you experiment with both versions and see what kind of an impact it has on your retrospectives. When properly used, the Prime Directive can be a valuable tool.","# Using Essence\nCards using the Essence Language described in this guide represent the key concepts of working practices. This opens up a whole new set of powerful games, allowing a team to reason about and improve their way of working.\nThe cards provide focus on the essentials to provoke the right conversations, allowing the whole team to reason and collaborate effectively.\nA number of guided collaborations or ‘serious games’ have been evolved, refined and shared, and teams will often make up their own once they have the cards in their hands. Physically interacting with the physical cards and gameboards (or electronic equivalents) helps to establish shared understanding, builds consensus and encourages collective decision-making. Some examples of these kinds of serious games include:  \nLearning new practices during coaching sessions and training events\n- Team Retrospectives, improving the team’s way of working (pictured above)\n- Planning Activities efficiently, coordinating the team and other stakeholders\n- Agreeing responsibilities within the team and with external stakeholders\n- Tracking key progress items and status indicators using Alphas and their states\n- Capturing new practices ensuring a shared understanding within the team.  \nA number of serious games can also be played with just the information provided by the Essence Kernel and are applicable regardless of the actual practices a team are using. These games are especially powerful as they give an overall holistic view of the work. This high- level view is often invisible while the teams are focused on the lower-level details. Some examples include:\n- Determining the current status of the endeavour using the top level kernel Alphas and their States (pictured above)\n- Planning the next key achievements at this top level\n- Comparing the current status against a defined high-level goal or milestone\n- Reviewing a way of working for improvement opportunities and gaps\n- Assessing the competencies within a team against what is needed"],"answer":"As a group of students working on a mobile game project, I recommend the following practices:\n\n1. **Use Agile methodologies**: Break down your project into smaller, manageable tasks and prioritize them using techniques like MoSCoW or INVEST principles.\n2. **Conduct regular retrospectives**: Hold regular meetings to reflect on your progress, discuss challenges, and identify areas for improvement. Use techniques like the Prime Directive to set a positive tone.\n3. **Create a product backlog**: Develop a list of user stories, prioritize them, and use them to guide your development process.\n4. **Use Essence cards**: Use the Essence Language and cards to represent key concepts and facilitate conversations about your way of working.\n5. **Play \"serious games\"**: Engage in activities like Progress Poker, Chase the State, and Objective Go to improve your team's collaboration, decision-making, and problem-solving skills.\n6. **Define a Definition of Ready and Definition of Done**: Establish clear criteria for when a task is ready to start and when it's complete.\n7. **Use version control and collaboration tools**: Utilize tools like Git and Slack to manage your code and collaborate with your team.\n\nBy following these practices, you'll be well on your way to creating a successful mobile game and developing essential skills for future projects."}

Agile methods and practices can also help students develop valuable soft skills such as communication, teamwork, and adaptability. Practicing agile, they should learn how to work effectively with a product owner and other developers, respond to changing requirements, and aiming at continuously improving their work processes. Although there are several agile methods, two are especially outstanding: Scrum [21] and Extreme Programming [3]. The former is the most popular, be- cause it enforces the major Agile principles of iterative, value- based, incremental delivery by frequently gathering customer feedback and embracing requirements change. The latter is also well known, as it introduced a set of agile best practices that can be easily be applied and exploited by students, such as pair programming, the collective property of code, requirements as user stories, etc. An important value fostered by the agile vision is that the process is less important than individuals and interactions. We interpret this value suggesting the students that they can choose the best practices to use\nduring the development. Planning and implementing their own Agile software process can also help students develop a sense of ownership and responsibility over their work. They will have a better understanding of what is expected of them, and they will be more motivated to achieve their goals. Overall, learning how to plan their own Agile software process and pick Agile best practices can be a valuable learning experience for students, preparing them for successful careers in software development and helping them develop important skills for any profession.\nIn this paper we report on our experiences with training to agile vision and selection of agile best practices our Computer science students in a software engineering class. We adopt the Essence approach [12] that is based on a visual language able to capture combinations of agile practices and the state of their enactment inside a development process. Essence is formally an international standard issued by OMG [18].\nLearning how to plan their own Agile software process and choose which best practices apply can help students become more effective and efﬁcient in their software development work. They will be able to break down complex projects into smaller, more manageable tasks and work collaboratively with their team members to complete these tasks in a timely manner. We use a team building game to help the students to select their role in a Scrum-like team. Then we ask them to use a number of state-of-the art open source tools, like Taiga, GitLab, and SonarQube, to help them during the development and to collect data useful for the analysis we will report in this paper. We also suggest them to follow the Essence approach to process enactment and retrospective analysis. Concerning the evaluation of this experience, we have developed a maturity model to analyze how student teams perform their teamwork. We observed more than one hundred students divided in teams averaging ﬁve members each.\nSpeciﬁcally, we observed 136 students (57 in 2021 and 79 in 2022) divided in 27 teams (11 in 2021 and 16 in 2022) with an average of 5 components each (three teams had six components and two teams had four).\nThe project consisted in creating a Twitter client enriched with\na dashboard with several ﬁltering and visual analytics features.\nThe teamwork was organized following a Scrum-like ap- proach: each team had to work for at least three 3-week-sprints using CAS services and then write a ﬁnal report to summarize the development process. Each student had then to complete an individual questionnaire to evaluate the experience.\nWe collected several data. The main data sources were the ﬁnal reports, the individual questionnaires and, within the CAS environment, Gitlab, Taiga, and SonarQube. The ﬁnal reports were a fundamental source of data since, in addition to containing all mandatory information, most teams included additional elements regarding their own process. Tools were shared with the instructors. Gitlab was used to analyze the structure of the teams’ repositories and obtain data regarding the frequency of commits and the tests performed. Taiga was used by the teams to manage their sprints and their retrospectives (conducted using Essence cards); the instructors, as Product Owners, could see the progresses on the product and its documentation. SonarQube was used for extracting product quality data and technical debt data.\nThis paper has the following structure: Section II presents some related works; Section III overviews the approach we fol- lowed, describing the preliminary activities for team building, the product to be built by the teams, the process enacted, and the open source tools which were used. Section IV presents the results of the analysis of the data we collected; Section V discusses these results; ﬁnally, Section VI presents our conclusions and the work we are planning now.","# Continuous integration.\n- Pair writes tests and code for a task (= part of a user story)\n- Pair performs all unit testing\n- Pair performs integration of new unit with others\n- The pair performs all regression testing\n- The pair moves on to the next task with a clear mind (happens once or twice a day)\n- The goal is to prevent the “ _Integration Hell_ ”","# 1.5 The Prime Directive - Improving Agile Retrospectives\nSome facilitators begin their retrospectives by reading out the fundamental principle, the Prime Directive. First articulated by Norman Kerth in his book, Project Retrospectives: A Handbook for Team Reviews [ 1], the Prime Directive is designed to set the stage for the retrospective:\nRegardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time,\ntheir skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand.\nThis principle is read aloud at the beginning of a retrospective, precisely in this wording.\nThe idea is to make it clear to everyone that we are all human and make mistakes. The principle also points out that we shouldn’t assume that things have been done badly deliberately.\n**Practical Tip**\nYou don’t need to read out the Prime Directive at every retrospective. In later retrospectives, simply reminding people of it is enough.\nMany retrospective facilitators swear by the Prime Directive. They feel that retrospectives that don’t start with this fundamental principle are less effective and therefore less useful. Pat Kua writes [Kua 2012] that this is related to the Pygmalion [ 11] or Rosenthal effect, or what is commonly known as “ ‘a self-fulfilling prophecy.’ ”\nThe effect of a teacher’s preconceptions about his students might be an example of the Rosenthal effect. The idea is that a teacher’s positive preconception about a student (‘that student is a high achiever’) will affect the teacher’s behavior in such a way as to create confirmation of his expectations. What happens is that the teacher subtly transmits his preconception to the student through, for example, more one-to-one attention, more time given for response, frequency and strength of praise or blame, or high-performance requirements. This is an unconscious rather than deliberate course of action.\nIn essence, the theory is that someone who is treated as having certain characteristics will manifest them. In fact, Rosenthal’s results were repeatedly called into question and could only be reproduced in 40 percent of cases [ 11].\nI personally believe that the success of a retrospective depends not on the careful reading out of the Prime Directive, but rather upon the values that it describes. I have carried out many successful retrospectives during which I did not explicitly mention the Prime Directive. I’m not saying that reading the\nprinciple isn’t a good thing; in new teams or established teams that are about to experience their first retrospective, this ritual can have a very positive, if not measurable, effect. In my experience, however, you lose that positive effect if you read out the directive at every retrospective. Repetition does to the directive what frequent flying does to pre-flight safety briefings. The first time you fly, you pay close attention. However, with prolonged exposure, you pay less and less attention until, in the end, you hardly notice it’s happening.\nA positive attitude is essential for a successful retrospective, but I believe there are many ways to achieve that attitude and the Prime Directive is only one (and one that is certainly no guarantee of success).\nThere is also an alternative prime directive that is somewhat longer but may work better for some teams [ 12]. I personally like the fact that it is written in the first person and is thus more appealing:\nSome days are better than others. Some days I’m in the “flow” state, doing awesome work. Some days I come to the end of a day and realized I’ve wasted a lot of time, made mistakes that I should have foreseen, or wish I could have done something differently.\nRegardless, those days have happened and our purpose here is to find out:\nWhat can we learn from our past actions and thinking that will inform and guide our future actions and thinking so that we can do a little better?\nHow can we change our environment (“the system”) so that it’s easier for us to do awesome work and less likely for us for us to waste time and make mistakes?\nLike the original Prime Directive, this version describes the goal of a retrospective and articulates the underlying principles. Also like the original, this alternative is just a tool and does not guarantee a successful retrospective. My advice is that you experiment with both versions and see what kind of an impact it has on your retrospectives. When properly used, the Prime Directive can be a valuable tool.","# Essentialization moves us to...\nEssentialization moves us to Industrial Scale Engineering and a Leaming Organization.\nIndustrial Scale Engineering:\n- Systematically address the methods to allow for dramatic efficiency and quality improvements through tooling and techniques\n- Right size the applied methods to fit the problems at hand with minimum overhead, which shortens time to market\n- Application of many engineering practices for:\n- requirements such as use cases, features, user stories\n- design and architecture patterns, for developing components and services\n- testing complex, distributed systems\n- encouraging systematic reuse\n- helping engineers code with confidence\n- architectural concerns such as concurrency, security, user experience, micro-services, and data protection\n- Application of practices with broader architectural concerns such as enterprise architecture, product-line architecture, service-oriented architecture and the architecture of systems of systems\n- Working systematically instead of relying on heroics\nLeaming Organization:\n- Common language / common culture\n- Create your own kernel - if needed\n- Establish shared common ground for all teams\n- Exchange and share practices and experiences\n- Increase the competency of every individual\n- Building practice libraries accessible to everyone\n- Continuously improve\n- Nurture communities of practices\n- Share practice\n- Directed coaching\n- Practice-based accreditation\n- Create winning teams\n- Plug and play methods and practices\n- Track progress and health\n- Lightweight, practical governance\n- More competent people will\n- develop better software faster and cheaper with happier customers\n- innovate more effectively"],"answer":"To make your Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline more reliable, adopt the following best practices:\n\n1. **Automate testing**: Run automated tests for each code change to catch bugs and errors early.\n2. **Use version control**: Version control systems like Git help track changes and ensure reproducibility.\n3. **Implement continuous integration**: Run automated builds and tests for each code change to catch errors early.\n4. **Use environment configuration management**: Manage environment configurations to ensure consistency across different environments.\n5. **Monitor and log**: Monitor and log your pipeline to identify issues and troubleshoot problems quickly.\n6. **Implement rollback and recovery**: Implement rollback and recovery mechanisms to quickly recover from failures.\n7. **Use a CI/CD tool**: Use a CI/CD tool like Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, or CircleCI to automate and manage your pipeline.\n8. **Test and validate**: Test and validate your pipeline regularly to ensure it's working as expected.\n\nBy following these best practices, you can make your CI pipeline more reliable, efficient, and effective."}

METHOD\nIn this section we will present our research method. First, before the course we built and conﬁgured an experimental open source environment, inspired by Jira, to be used by the student teams and also useful to collect process data.\nWe asked the teams to start their project work with a team building activity, using the serious game Scrumble1, aiming at improving the reciprocal knowledge and training themselves with a simulated form of Scrum cooperation. Fig.1 shows a selﬁe by a team after having played the game.\nWe produced also an online version of the game, so that the teams could play remotely during the pandemic.\nFigure 1. A team at the end of a game of Scrumble\nAfter the teams completed and self-evaluated their team build- ing we described them the product to build: a Twitter client with several capabilities for visual analytics, to be applied to speciﬁc situations: eg. an earthquake, to signal emergency situations, or a travel with some friends, to signal the positions of the participants during the visit to some city or area. We also asked the teams to follow a Scrum-like process, that could be adapted to their needs using the Essence approach. Essence allows to select and organize speciﬁc practices (eg. pair programming or retrospective with some special activities) still keeping Scrum as a reference framework. At the end of the project the teams had to produce a demo and a process report. The exam consisted in a product demo and a ﬁnal retrospective conducted together with the instructors."],"answer":"To improve communication within your distributed teams, consider implementing the following practices:\n\n1. **Regular virtual check-ins**: Hold daily or bi-weekly virtual meetings to ensure everyone is on the same page.\n2. **Async communication channels**: Use tools like Slack or Microsoft Teams for asynchronous communication, allowing team members to respond at their convenience.\n3. **Clear sprint goals**: Establish clear and concise sprint goals to ensure everyone understands what needs to be accomplished.\n4. **Retrospectives**: Regularly hold retrospectives, like the MAD, SAD, GLAD practice, to reflect on what's working and what areas need improvement.\n5. **Define communication protocols**: Establish clear communication protocols for different scenarios, such as code reviews or feature discussions.\n6. **Foster open feedback**: Encourage team members to provide constructive feedback and create a safe environment for open discussion.\n7. **Use collaboration tools**: Utilize collaboration tools like Trello, Asana, or Jira to visualize work and facilitate teamwork.\n\nBy implementing these practices, you can improve communication and collaboration within your distributed teams."}

INTRODUCTION\nAgile methodologies are widely used in the software industry, where they are applied using a variety of processes and best practices. Agile methods and practices can also help students develop valuable soft skills such as communication, teamwork, and adaptability. Practicing agile, they should learn how to work effectively with a product owner and other developers, respond to changing requirements, and aiming at continuously improving their work processes. Although there are several agile methods, two are especially outstanding: Scrum [21] and Extreme Programming [3]. The former is the most popular, be- cause it enforces the major Agile principles of iterative, value- based, incremental delivery by frequently gathering customer feedback and embracing requirements change. The latter is also well known, as it introduced a set of agile best practices that can be easily be applied and exploited by students, such as pair programming, the collective property of code, requirements as user stories, etc. An important value fostered by the agile vision is that the process is less important than individuals and interactions. We interpret this value suggesting the students that they can choose the best practices to use\nduring the development. Planning and implementing their own Agile software process can also help students develop a sense of ownership and responsibility over their work. They will have a better understanding of what is expected of them, and they will be more motivated to achieve their goals. Overall, learning how to plan their own Agile software process and pick Agile best practices can be a valuable learning experience for students, preparing them for successful careers in software development and helping them develop important skills for any profession.\nIn this paper we report on our experiences with training to agile vision and selection of agile best practices our Computer science students in a software engineering class. We adopt the Essence approach [12] that is based on a visual language able to capture combinations of agile practices and the state of their enactment inside a development process. Essence is formally an international standard issued by OMG [18].\nLearning how to plan their own Agile software process and choose which best practices apply can help students become more effective and efﬁcient in their software development work. They will be able to break down complex projects into smaller, more manageable tasks and work collaboratively with their team members to complete these tasks in a timely manner. We use a team building game to help the students to select their role in a Scrum-like team. Then we ask them to use a number of state-of-the art open source tools, like Taiga, GitLab, and SonarQube, to help them during the development and to collect data useful for the analysis we will report in this paper. We also suggest them to follow the Essence approach to process enactment and retrospective analysis. Concerning the evaluation of this experience, we have developed a maturity model to analyze how student teams perform their teamwork. We observed more than one hundred students divided in teams averaging ﬁve members each.\nSpeciﬁcally, we observed 136 students (57 in 2021 and 79 in 2022) divided in 27 teams (11 in 2021 and 16 in 2022) with an average of 5 components each (three teams had six components and two teams had four).\nThe project consisted in creating a Twitter client enriched with\na dashboard with several ﬁltering and visual analytics features.\nThe teamwork was organized following a Scrum-like ap- proach: each team had to work for at least three 3-week-sprints using CAS services and then write a ﬁnal report to summarize the development process. Each student had then to complete an individual questionnaire to evaluate the experience.\nWe collected several data. The main data sources were the ﬁnal reports, the individual questionnaires and, within the CAS environment, Gitlab, Taiga, and SonarQube. The ﬁnal reports were a fundamental source of data since, in addition to containing all mandatory information, most teams included additional elements regarding their own process. Tools were shared with the instructors. Gitlab was used to analyze the structure of the teams’ repositories and obtain data regarding the frequency of commits and the tests performed. Taiga was used by the teams to manage their sprints and their retrospectives (conducted using Essence cards); the instructors, as Product Owners, could see the progresses on the product and its documentation. SonarQube was used for extracting product quality data and technical debt data.\nThis paper has the following structure: Section II presents some related works; Section III overviews the approach we fol- lowed, describing the preliminary activities for team building, the product to be built by the teams, the process enacted, and the open source tools which were used. Section IV presents the results of the analysis of the data we collected; Section V discusses these results; ﬁnally, Section VI presents our conclusions and the work we are planning now.","# Structured conversations\nThe team chooses practices to be used during development.\nThen practice by practice is analyzed and evaluated by individuals (red=bad, green=good).\nChosen practices can be changed from sprint to sprint (but better not to change them _during_ the sprint).\nEssence can help the team form an opinion (see next slides).\n**Example of First Retrospective**\nToo little time spent on helping and managing work distribution by the Scrum Master.\nDevshave spent too little time developing the chosen features.\nShallow planning of work during Sprint Planning.\nDaily Scrum done without consistency.\nSprint Goal defined at beginning of sprint unclear.\nPoor communication during work.\n**Example of Last Retrospective**.\nIncreased time spent on this phase (from less than an hour to more than 3 hours).\nGeneral improvement in grades awarded.\nPrevious retrospective discussions resulted in a tangible improvement in the team's collaborative spirit.\nImprovement in the management of the retrospective phase.\nSelf-criticism of a DEV."],"answer":"To assess if your current Agile practices are truly effective, consider the following:\n\n1. **Regularly review and reflect**: Conduct retrospectives to identify areas for improvement and adjust your practices accordingly.\n2. **Measure progress**: Track key metrics such as lead time, cycle time, and customer satisfaction to evaluate the effectiveness of your practices.\n3. **Gather feedback**: Collect feedback from team members, stakeholders, and customers to identify strengths and weaknesses.\n4. **Evaluate against Agile principles**: Assess whether your practices align with the Agile principles, such as prioritizing customer satisfaction, embracing change, and continuous improvement.\n5. **Use tools like Essence**: Utilize frameworks like Essence to capture and evaluate the state of your Agile practices and identify areas for improvement."}

Directed lines in Figure 7 that connect Scrum activities with each other are called activity associations in Essence [3]. Activity association represents an “end-before-start” association (viz., sequence flow).\nOut of 15 activity spaces only 9 are addressed by Scrum practice. Unaddressed activity spaces are: shape the system, implement the system, deploy the system, stop the work, use the system, and operate the system. The partial coverage of activity spaces stems from the fact that Scrum practice focuses on the management of product and project, and does not provide guidance for development techniques such as requirement modeling, architecture design, coding and testing. Another limitation of Scrum practice is that it does not address the full life cycle of software delivery. It lacks guidance for release, transition and operation endeavors. Therefore, organizations often combine Scrum practice with other complementary practices such as agile modeling [27], agile\narchitecture design [28], extreme programming (XP) [29, 30], release and transition processes, asset reuse, etc. [28, 31] One of key advantages in mapping the practices to Essence kernel is the visibility it brings to potential gaps as we see in this section.\nFigure 7. Mapping of Scrum Activities to Essence Activity Spaces\nIn Figure 7, the Product Envisioning activity is mapped to two activity spaces: explore possibilities and understand stakeholder needs. Likewise, the Release Planning and Sprint Review activities each realizes multiple activity spaces. On the other hand, multiple activities including Daily Scrum, Sprint Review and Sprint Retrospective are mapped to the track progress activity space. As such, the activity-to-activity-space mapping is many-to-many.\nWhen an activity tries to realize multiple activity spaces, one may suspect that the given practice lacks a detailed guideline for that activity. Product Envisioning alone indeed requires a host of critical activities such as market analysis, competition analysis, key features selection, value proposition, financial projection, risk identification, etc. The Scrum practice does not go into details about those activities and the Product Owner will need to resort to other practices such as software product management (SPM) practices to deal with them. The same holds for Release Planning. The Product Owner may well want to combine some activities in the SPM discipline to deal with target market segmentation, internal and external positioning, non-functional requirements, product architecture, pricing, etc. On the other hand, Scrum requires several activities such as Daily Scrum, Sprint Review and Sprint Retrospective for the track progress activity space. This confirms that Scrum puts emphasis on project planning and tracking and provides guidelines at a detail level.\nIn Figure 8, different roles in Scrum practice are associated with Essence competencies (Figure 2C). As Scrum Teams are self-directed teams, Developers need to possess leadership and management competencies as well.\nFigure 8. Mapping of Scrum Roles to Essence Competencies.\nIt should be noted that there is not a single way to represent a practice, such as Scrum, in Essence. As an example, Sprint Planning could be mapped to the prepare to do the work, or the coordinate activity, or the support the team activity space, or any combination of them. The value of this exercise, regardless of how you choose to conduct this mapping, is the discussion that ensues within each organization related to potential gaps and subsequent practice improvement decisions."],"answer":"Based on the Essence Kernel Activity Spaces, your team's current practices (User Stories, Sprint Planning, and Daily Stand-ups) are not addressing the following Activity Spaces:\n\n1. **Shape the system**: This Activity Space involves defining the architecture and design of the system.\n2. **Implement the system**: This Activity Space involves coding and testing the system.\n3. **Deploy the system**: This Activity Space involves deploying the system to production.\n4. **Stop the work**: This Activity Space involves determining when to stop work on a feature or project.\n5. **Use the system**: This Activity Space involves using the system to achieve business goals.\n6. **Operate the system**: This Activity Space involves maintaining and supporting the system in production.\n\nThese gaps suggest that your team may need to adopt additional practices to cover these areas, such as agile modeling, agile architecture design, extreme programming (XP), release and transition processes, and asset reuse."}

First articulated by Norman Kerth in his book, Project Retrospectives: A Handbook for Team Reviews [ 1], the Prime Directive is designed to set the stage for the retrospective:\nRegardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time,\ntheir skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand.\nThis principle is read aloud at the beginning of a retrospective, precisely in this wording.\nThe idea is to make it clear to everyone that we are all human and make mistakes. The principle also points out that we shouldn’t assume that things have been done badly deliberately.\n**Practical Tip**\nYou don’t need to read out the Prime Directive at every retrospective. In later retrospectives, simply reminding people of it is enough.\nMany retrospective facilitators swear by the Prime Directive. They feel that retrospectives that don’t start with this fundamental principle are less effective and therefore less useful. Pat Kua writes [Kua 2012] that this is related to the Pygmalion [ 11] or Rosenthal effect, or what is commonly known as “ ‘a self-fulfilling prophecy.’ ”\nThe effect of a teacher’s preconceptions about his students might be an example of the Rosenthal effect. The idea is that a teacher’s positive preconception about a student (‘that student is a high achiever’) will affect the teacher’s behavior in such a way as to create confirmation of his expectations. What happens is that the teacher subtly transmits his preconception to the student through, for example, more one-to-one attention, more time given for response, frequency and strength of praise or blame, or high-performance requirements. This is an unconscious rather than deliberate course of action.\nIn essence, the theory is that someone who is treated as having certain characteristics will manifest them. In fact, Rosenthal’s results were repeatedly called into question and could only be reproduced in 40 percent of cases [ 11].\nI personally believe that the success of a retrospective depends not on the careful reading out of the Prime Directive, but rather upon the values that it describes. I have carried out many successful retrospectives during which I did not explicitly mention the Prime Directive.

Activities are important because, unless we collectively actually do something (successfully), nothing is ever achieved or produced.  \nA good Activity description will include guidance on:\n- What outcomes the Activity produces or achieves\n- What we should do to achieve these outcomes\n- What kinds of Competencies at what Levels are needed to undertake the activity successfully.  \n## Activity Space  \nAn Activity Space is a placeholder for something to be done in an endeavor, such as to Understand the Requirements.  \nThe Essence Kernel defines a number of Activity Spaces that together represent the kinds of things that we need to do to progress any software engineering endeavor.  \nActivity Spaces can be used to group together related Activities that different Practices define.","# Essence Kernel Activity Spaces  \nAs with the Kernel Alphas, these can be used both independently and to help define practices:  \nThe set of Activity Spaces can be used to assess coverage and do gap analysis across a team’s current way of working (do we have an agreed approach to doing these things?)\nActivities in practices can be placed within Kernel Activity Spaces to give a clear indication of what general kinds of things the practice and its activities will help the team to achieve – e.g. a Find User Stories Activity is located within the Understand the Requirements Activity Space.","# Activity\nDef: Activitiesare things which practitioners do\n- Activities examples are: holding a meeting, analysing a requirement, writing code, testing or peer review\nPractitioners often struggle to determine the appropriate degree of detail or formality with an activity, or exactly how to go about conducting the activity.\n- This is another motivation for explicit practices as they can provide guidance to practitioners in selecting appropriate activities as well as provide guidance in how to go about conducting each activity.\nA practice may include several activities that are specific to the practice being described.\n- Activities are specific and not standard - they are not a part of Essence.\nAn activity is always bound to a specific practice, it cannot “float around” among the practices.\n- If you find an activity that needs to be reused by many practices, then you may want to create a separate practice including this activity.  \n## Activity Card\nAn Activity card generally has:\n- Activity Name (ex.: Write Code)\n- Very brief Activity description (ex.: Collaborate together to produce good quality code that meet requirements.)\n- Inputs for activity (ex.: Requirements: Bounded)\n- Competency to conduct activity (ex.: Implement the System Activity Space: Development 1)\n- Outputs of activity (ex.: Requirements: Addressed, Software System: Ready, Code: Code Completed)"],"answer":"The \"Prepare to do the work\" Activity Space can be addressed through practices such as Agile's Sprint Preparation or Scrum's Sprint Planning. \n\n- Agile's Sprint Preparation involves planning and preparation activities such as estimating tasks, assigning tasks, and defining sprint goals. This practice helps the team to prepare for the upcoming sprint and ensures everyone is aligned and ready to start working.\n\n- Scrum's Sprint Planning is a time-boxed event where the team and Product Owner discuss and agree on the sprint goals, sprint backlog, and tasks to be completed during the sprint. This practice helps to prepare the team for the upcoming sprint by ensuring everyone is aligned and understands their roles and responsibilities.\n\nBoth of these practices help to achieve the outcomes of the \"Prepare to do the work\" Activity Space by ensuring that the team is prepared, aligned, and ready to start working on the tasks at hand."}

DESCRIPTION OF SCRUM PRACTICE USING ESSENCE KERNEL\nScrum and its variants are the most popular agile project management practices today. According to [20], 72% of about 4000 software practitioners surveyed used Scrum (54%), Scrum/XP hybrid (11%) or Scrumban (7%). There is a rich literature and web content on Scrum practice [21, 22, 23, 24]. We consider the following elements to comprise\nthe Scrum practice which will be translated into Essence kernel and language: Stakeholder, Product Envisioning, Product Vision, Release Planning, Product Backlog, Scrum Team, Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team, Sprint, Sprint Planning, Sprint Backlog, Task Board, Daily Scrum, Definition of Done, Work Remaining, Burndown Chart, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective and Product Increment. Definitions of those terms can be found in [21, 24].\nLike other software engineering practices, Scrum practice has been textually described using a set of unique terminologies with a few graphical aids and tools (such as Task Board, Burndown Chart) to facilitate the understanding and enforcement of its ceremonies. The OMG Essence specification [3] includes an example that illustrates an Essence-based description of Scrum practice. The same Essence-based description of Scrum was compared with a SPEM 2.0-based description of Scrum in [17] to demonstrate the fundamental difference between Essence and SPEM 2.0. A key difference was found to be the notion of alpha with alpha states and the usage of states to help assess progress and provide planning guidance. However, neither [3] nor [17] explained how a practice can be systematically translated into an Essence-based description. To the best of the authors’ knowledge this is the first time in literature that a robust procedure is presented for converting any software engineering practice into an Essence-based description.\nOnly alphas in the Essence kernel were used for evaluating the health of project progress in [4, 5]. Using only alphas was sufficient to evaluate the progress and health in a practice-agnostic way. However, to describe a practice using Essence kernel, we use all types of kernel elements— alphas, activity spaces and competencies—as well as patterns in this paper. We use all of them because existing practices are mostly defined in terms of activities (such as Sprint Planning), work products (such as Sprint Backlog) and roles (such as Development Team), which manifest activity spaces, alphas and role patterns, respectively. A pattern in the Essence language is a named structure made up of several Essence elements [3]. The role pattern associates practice activities, work products and competencies such that role R possesses competencies C to be able to perform activities A to produce work products W.\nWe apply the Activity-State Mapping Algorithm (Figure 5) presented in [25, 26] to assign practice activities to activity spaces, and to specify alpha states and checklists as the criteria to check the health and progress of each practice activity. By mapping practice activities to activity spaces, one can obtain the goal states for each practice activity based on Figure 4, and the Essence-provided checklists associated with each goal state. This supports the augmentation of existing practices with quality gates and governance procedures.\nActivity-State Mapping Algorithm:\n*Step 1*: Determine the set of activities to be performed in executing a chosen practice.\n*Step 2*: Repeat for each activity listed in Step 1.\n*Step 2.1*: Assign the activity to a set of activity spaces.\n*Step 2.2*: Merge the goal states of the chosen set of activity spaces so as to generate the candidate goal states of the activity. (See Figure 4.) Determine the goal states of the activity as a subset of the candidate goal states.\n*Step 2.3*: Collect all the checkpoints corresponding to the goal states of the activity listed in Step 2.2.\n*Step 2.4*: Determine the activity checklist for the activity as a subset of the checkpoints collected in 2.3.

First articulated by Norman Kerth in his book, Project Retrospectives: A Handbook for Team Reviews [ 1], the Prime Directive is designed to set the stage for the retrospective:\nRegardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time,\ntheir skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand.\nThis principle is read aloud at the beginning of a retrospective, precisely in this wording.\nThe idea is to make it clear to everyone that we are all human and make mistakes. The principle also points out that we shouldn’t assume that things have been done badly deliberately.\n**Practical Tip**\nYou don’t need to read out the Prime Directive at every retrospective. In later retrospectives, simply reminding people of it is enough.\nMany retrospective facilitators swear by the Prime Directive. They feel that retrospectives that don’t start with this fundamental principle are less effective and therefore less useful. Pat Kua writes [Kua 2012] that this is related to the Pygmalion [ 11] or Rosenthal effect, or what is commonly known as “ ‘a self-fulfilling prophecy.’ ”\nThe effect of a teacher’s preconceptions about his students might be an example of the Rosenthal effect. The idea is that a teacher’s positive preconception about a student (‘that student is a high achiever’) will affect the teacher’s behavior in such a way as to create confirmation of his expectations. What happens is that the teacher subtly transmits his preconception to the student through, for example, more one-to-one attention, more time given for response, frequency and strength of praise or blame, or high-performance requirements. This is an unconscious rather than deliberate course of action.\nIn essence, the theory is that someone who is treated as having certain characteristics will manifest them. In fact, Rosenthal’s results were repeatedly called into question and could only be reproduced in 40 percent of cases [ 11].\nI personally believe that the success of a retrospective depends not on the careful reading out of the Prime Directive, but rather upon the values that it describes. I have carried out many successful retrospectives during which I did not explicitly mention the Prime Directive. I’m not saying that reading the\nprinciple isn’t a good thing; in new teams or established teams that are about to experience their first retrospective, this ritual can have a very positive, if not measurable, effect. In my experience, however, you lose that positive effect if you read out the directive at every retrospective. Repetition does to the directive what frequent flying does to pre-flight safety briefings. The first time you fly, you pay close attention. However, with prolonged exposure, you pay less and less attention until, in the end, you hardly notice it’s happening.\nA positive attitude is essential for a successful retrospective, but I believe there are many ways to achieve that attitude and the Prime Directive is only one (and one that is certainly no guarantee of success).\nThere is also an alternative prime directive that is somewhat longer but may work better for some teams [ 12]. I personally like the fact that it is written in the first person and is thus more appealing:\nSome days are better than others. Some days I’m in the “flow” state, doing awesome work. Some days I come to the end of a day and realized I’ve wasted a lot of time, made mistakes that I should have foreseen, or wish I could have done something differently.\nRegardless, those days have happened and our purpose here is to find out:\nWhat can we learn from our past actions and thinking that will inform and guide our future actions and thinking so that we can do a little better?\nHow can we change our environment (“the system”) so that it’s easier for us to do awesome work and less likely for us for us to waste time and make mistakes?\nLike the original Prime Directive, this version describes the goal of a retrospective and articulates the underlying principles. Also like the original, this alternative is just a tool and does not guarantee a successful retrospective. My advice is that you experiment with both versions and see what kind of an impact it has on your retrospectives. When properly used, the Prime Directive can be a valuable tool.","# Other patterns that could be added to the of Retrospective Practice\nOther than:\n- Mad, Sad, Glad\n- 5 Whys\n- 4 Ls\n- Where Are We?\nThese are two more (Essence) patterns that can be added to Retrospectives:\n- SEMAT Method SWOT\n- Speedboat / Sailing Ship","# Structured conversations\nThe team chooses practices to be used during development.\nThen practice by practice is analyzed and evaluated by individuals (red=bad, green=good).\nChosen practices can be changed from sprint to sprint (but better not to change them _during_ the sprint).\nEssence can help the team form an opinion (see next slides).\n**Example of First Retrospective**\nToo little time spent on helping and managing work distribution by the Scrum Master.\nDevshave spent too little time developing the chosen features.\nShallow planning of work during Sprint Planning.\nDaily Scrum done without consistency.\nSprint Goal defined at beginning of sprint unclear.\nPoor communication during work.\n**Example of Last Retrospective**.\nIncreased time spent on this phase (from less than an hour to more than 3 hours).\nGeneral improvement in grades awarded.\nPrevious retrospective discussions resulted in a tangible improvement in the team's collaborative spirit.\nImprovement in the management of the retrospective phase.\nSelf-criticism of a DEV.","# Restrospective Essence cards  \nThe following Essence items (cards) form the Retrospective practice.\nThis is how to essentialize Retrospectives (how to translate the Retrospective practice in Essence terms).\nIt's important to note that translations may vary depending on the level of detail needed.  \nThe activites of the Retrospective are:\n- Hold a Retrospective\nThe alphas of a retrospective are:\n- Improvement\nPatterns are:\n- Feedback\n- Mad, Sad, Glad\nRequired competency levels are:\n- Leadership\n- Management"],"answer":"Using the Essence language, a retrospective can be described as follows:\n\n**Alpha:** Improvement (identifying areas for improvement and implementing changes)\n\n**Activity Space:** Improve the Way of Working (reflecting on past experiences and identifying opportunities for growth)\n\n**Activity:** Hold a Retrospective (facilitating a discussion to identify areas for improvement and develop an action plan)\n\n**Patterns:**\n\n* Feedback (encouraging open and honest communication)\n* Mad, Sad, Glad (structured conversation to identify emotions and areas for improvement)\n* SEMAT Method SWOT (analyzing strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats)\n* Speedboat / Sailing Ship (identifying factors that are helping or hindering progress)\n\n**Competencies:**\n\n* Leadership (facilitating the retrospective and guiding the team towards improvement)\n* Management (ensuring the team is working effectively and efficiently)\n\n**Work Products:**\n\n* Retrospective Report (documenting the discussion and action plan)\n* Improvement Plan (outlining the changes to be implemented)"}

Practitioners employ a vast variety of methods and practices and typically tailor existing ones to create cus- tomized versions to better suit individual organizations [5]. While attempts to introduce universal SE methodologies have been made in the past, the present situation out on the field ultimately underlines the lack of success on this front. In a recent attempt to create a common ground for methods and practices, the SEMAT initiative (semat.org) pro- posed the Essence Theory of Software Engineering (Essence hereafter) [11].\nEssence is a modular, method-agnostic framework for SE endeavors that can be tai- lored to suit any SE context [8]. This modular and extensible nature of Essence, while its primary strength, is also its perhaps greatest weakness. As Essence needs to be tai- lored for specific contexts to reach its full potential, its adoption is resource-intensive [6]. This resource-intensive adoption process of Essence is, in part, likely to explain its current lack of widespread adoption among practitioners [6, 13].  \nFor development frameworks and methodologies to gain traction among practition- ers, tools to support their adoption and use are needed. This is perhaps even more im- portant for Essence given its already resource-intensive adoption. To this end, e.g. Gra- ziotin & Abrahamsson [6] have presented SematAcc to make the Essence kernel easier to utilize. However, further tooling covering other aspects of Essence such as graph- drawing is still needed. The existing Essence Practice Workbench comes with a steep learning curve and is not open source. While pen-and-paper and generic digital drawing tools offer reasonable alternatives, dedicated drawing tool can offer various advantages over general purpose alternatives. E.g. using a dedicated drawing tool, graphs can be far easier to modify and compose, and can offer more for communication purposes.\nTo further address the present lack of Essence-related tools and to facilitate the adop- tion of Essence, we present a tool for essentializing software engineering practice, which in practice means drawing graphs using the Essence graphical syntax. In this paper, we develop and evaluate Essencery – The Essence Practice Editor through a quasi-formal empirical experiment where IT students (n=16) employ the system to complete a task. Based on the experiment, we evaluate whether Essencery:\n1. Can be used to draw graphs using the Essence graphical syntax, and…\n2.

The first sub- section discusses Essence in detail while the second sub-section presents the Technol- ogy Acceptance Model [3], which is used as the data collection and analysis framework.\n## 2.1 The Essence Theory of Software Engineering\nEssence is the result of the SEMAT initiative and comprises of a kernel and a language [8]. The kernel is described using a subset of the language, identifying those SE method elements that \"are integral to all SE methods\". The language contains notational ele- ments that specify elements that are necessarily not part of every SE method, such as specific activities or roles. The kernel contains three views: an alpha view, a compe- tency view and an activity space view. The kernel is extensible, allowing for the crea- tion of customized kernels for e.g. SE endeavors including business analytics.\nIn practice, SE methods are described using the Essence language, a process that includes relating method-specific elements to the different elements of the Essence ker- nel. In the simplest case, the kernel itself can serve as a method. Generally, however, the kernel acts as a module in the description of a method and provides the building blocks upon which to begin describing the method.\nBy being method-agnostic and thus suitable for any SE context, Essence can provide common ground for SE and facilitate creating, adapting and using methods for specific endeavors as opposed to 'one-size-fits-all' \"method prisons\" [9]. Notably, Essence stands out from all other previously proposed methods and approaches since it has been standardized by the OMG (Object Management Group) [11].\n## 2.2 The Technology Acceptance Model\nOriginally proposed by Davis [3] in 1985, the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) is an influential IS theory intended to explain technology adoption on a general level. The model posits that external variables (e.g. software feature factors) affect the Perceived Usefulness (PU) and Perceived Ease of Use (PEOU) of potential users of a technology. PU and PEoU, then, result in a decision to either accept or reject the technology. In addition, Davis [3] established a link between PEoU and PU: the easier the system is to use, the more useful it often consequently is. Davis [3-4] posits that TAM, seen in Fig 1., is primarily useful for early-stage use testing, specifically in organizational settings.\nThe effectiveness of PU and PEOU in the context of technology acceptance has been demonstrated in empirical studies [1]. These two central constructs have remained the same in the sub-sequent versions of TAM (e.g. [4]), and similar constructs have been employed by competing models aiming to predict technology acceptance [e.g. 15]. However, while it has been established that PU and PEOU are effective at predicting technology acceptance, few empirical studies have tried to explain why this is the case [1]. In the context of TAM, little effort has gone towards explaining PU and PEOU in terms of system factors [2], although demographic variables have been established to affect perceptions of usefulness and ease of use [15]. In this study, we seek to under-","# Use case\nA use case is:\n- A sequence of actions a system performs that yields an observable result of value to a particular user.\n- That specific behaviour of a system, which participates in a collaboration with a user to deliver something of value for that user.\n- The smallest unit of activity that provides a meaningful result to the user.\n- The context for a set of related requirements.\nTo understand a use case we tell stories.\n- The stories cover both how to successfully achieve the goal and how to handle any problems that occur on the way."],"answer":"Using the Essence language, the difference between user stories and use cases can be explained as follows:\n\n**User Stories:**\n\n* **Alpha:** Opportunity (identifying opportunities to create value for users)\n* **Activity Space:** Understand the Requirements (gathering insights about user needs and goals)\n* **Activity:** Describe a User Story (writing a concise description of a software feature from the user's point of view)\n* **Work Product:** User Story (a concise description of a software feature)\n\n**Use Cases:**\n\n* **Alpha:** Opportunity (identifying opportunities to create value for users)\n* **Activity Space:** Understand the Requirements (gathering insights about user needs and goals)\n* **Activity:** Create a Use Case (describing a sequence of actions a system performs that yields an observable result of value to a particular user)\n* **Work Product:** Use Case (a description of a sequence of actions a system performs that yields an observable result of value to a particular user)\n\nThe key difference between user stories and use cases is that user stories are concise descriptions of software features from the user's point of view, while use cases are descriptions of a sequence of actions a system performs that yields an observable result of value to a particular user.

INTRODUCTION\nAgile methodologies are widely used in the software industry, where they are applied using a variety of processes and best practices. Agile methods and practices can also help students develop valuable soft skills such as communication, teamwork, and adaptability. Practicing agile, they should learn how to work effectively with a product owner and other developers, respond to changing requirements, and aiming at continuously improving their work processes. Although there are several agile methods, two are especially outstanding: Scrum [21] and Extreme Programming [3]. The former is the most popular, be- cause it enforces the major Agile principles of iterative, value- based, incremental delivery by frequently gathering customer feedback and embracing requirements change. The latter is also well known, as it introduced a set of agile best practices that can be easily be applied and exploited by students, such as pair programming, the collective property of code, requirements as user stories, etc. An important value fostered by the agile vision is that the process is less important than individuals and interactions. We interpret this value suggesting the students that they can choose the best practices to use\nduring the development. Planning and implementing their own Agile software process can also help students develop a sense of ownership and responsibility over their work. They will have a better understanding of what is expected of them, and they will be more motivated to achieve their goals. Overall, learning how to plan their own Agile software process and pick Agile best practices can be a valuable learning experience for students, preparing them for successful careers in software development and helping them develop important skills for any profession.\nIn this paper we report on our experiences with training to agile vision and selection of agile best practices our Computer science students in a software engineering class. We adopt the Essence approach [12] that is based on a visual language able to capture combinations of agile practices and the state of their enactment inside a development process. Essence is formally an international standard issued by OMG [18].\nLearning how to plan their own Agile software process and choose which best practices apply can help students become more effective and efﬁcient in their software development work. They will be able to break down complex projects into smaller, more manageable tasks and work collaboratively with their team members to complete these tasks in a timely manner. We use a team building game to help the students to select their role in a Scrum-like team. Then we ask them to use a number of state-of-the art open source tools, like Taiga, GitLab, and SonarQube, to help them during the development and to collect data useful for the analysis we will report in this paper. We also suggest them to follow the Essence approach to process enactment and retrospective analysis. Concerning the evaluation of this experience, we have developed a maturity model to analyze how student teams perform their teamwork. We observed more than one hundred students divided in teams averaging ﬁve members each.\nSpeciﬁcally, we observed 136 students (57 in 2021 and 79 in 2022) divided in 27 teams (11 in 2021 and 16 in 2022) with an average of 5 components each (three teams had six components and two teams had four).\nThe project consisted in creating a Twitter client enriched with\na dashboard with several ﬁltering and visual analytics features.\nThe teamwork was organized following a Scrum-like ap- proach: each team had to work for at least three 3-week-sprints using CAS services and then write a ﬁnal report to summarize the development process. Each student had then to complete an individual questionnaire to evaluate the experience.\nWe collected several data. The main data sources were the ﬁnal reports, the individual questionnaires and, within the CAS environment, Gitlab, Taiga, and SonarQube. The ﬁnal reports were a fundamental source of data since, in addition to containing all mandatory information, most teams included additional elements regarding their own process. Tools were shared with the instructors. Gitlab was used to analyze the structure of the teams’ repositories and obtain data regarding the frequency of commits and the tests performed. Taiga was used by the teams to manage their sprints and their retrospectives (conducted using Essence cards); the instructors, as Product Owners, could see the progresses on the product and its documentation. SonarQube was used for extracting product quality data and technical debt data.\nThis paper has the following structure: Section II presents some related works; Section III overviews the approach we fol- lowed, describing the preliminary activities for team building, the product to be built by the teams, the process enacted, and the open source tools which were used. Section IV presents the results of the analysis of the data we collected; Section V discusses these results; ﬁnally, Section VI presents our conclusions and the work we are planning now.","# Essence Pocket Guide\nA quick introduction to Essence.\nEssence has alphas, work products, competencies, activities, patterns and resources.  \n## Introduction\nEssence is a standard for the creation, use and improvement of software engineering practices and methods, which is maintained and published by the OMG international open standards consortium.\nThe spirit of Essence is to concentrate on the essential information and to optimize both the technical and human aspects of engineering by providing super-lightweight practices, often distilled into a small handful of cards, that focus on outcomes and minimize production of documentation.\nAs an industry standard, Essence describes a language and a kernel for these engineering practices:\n• The Essence Language enables practices to be expressed in a simple and standard form that ensures that they can be easily shared, understood, and applied both independently and in combination with other Essence practices.\n• The Essence Kernel provides the common ground for defining these Essence practices. It includes the essential elements that are always central to every software engineering endeavor. The Kernel also helps practitioners compare practices and make informed decisions about which practices to adopt, and how to apply and adapt them.","# II. RELATED WORKS\nThere are several papers concerning teaching agile teamwork and development in a university course. For instance, in [9], the authors describe their experiences teaching agile software development to computer science students and provide some recommendations for instructors; in [15] we found the de- scription of a course on agile methodologies taught to software engineering students analyzing their personalities and attitudes to teamwork; and in [17] there is a discussion of how the use of collaborative practices needs some maturity by the stu- dents. A paper exploiting Essence during an academic course project work is [13]; this paper discusses the difﬁculties of adopting Essence in the context of an undergraduate software engineering course. We searched for papers concerning team building in a university context: we found [14], which suggests an approach on how to integrate team building into university courses including agile teamwork.\nWe also have devoted some effort to look for papers exposing experiences on teaching agile using open source tools. The match between agile and open source seems natural, how- ever we have found only the paper [23], which reports an experience using tools quite different from those we used, in particular they used Redmine for project management and bugzilla as issue tracker.\nDocumentation of process choices, tools selections, and their rationale is an important factor in software development projects in order to support product quality and future mainte- nance. While several research publications address this topic, systematic approaches and tools are rarely found in practice, and not well covered in software engineering education. Lack of suitable process documentation is especially an issue in agile software development, where processes and tools are often seen as less important than working products [20].\nWe found some experiences of using a Scrum-like approach adaptable by the students, see for instance [19; 2].\nConcerning the evaluation of the product, our work has been inspired by the quality model described in the article by Hoegl and Gemuenden [11], and further developed by Lindsjørn et al. [16].\nThe maturity model for agile teamwork which inspired us to evaluate the process was proposed by Yin et al.[24], based on the one created by Chetankumar et al.[4]. Gren et al. have also discussed the concept of teamwork maturity in agile teams [10], and inﬂuenced our model as well.","# The Essence Language  \n## Essence Prime\nEssence provides a precise and actionable language to describe software engineering practices.\n- The constructs in the Essence language are in the form of shapes and icons.\n- The different shapes and icons each have different meaning.\nEssence categorizes the shapes and icons as:\n- Things to Work With\n- Things to Do\n- Competencies\nEssence provides explicit and actionable guidance.\n- This actionable guidance is delivered through associated checklists and guidelines."],"answer":"Here's the translation of the practice into the Essence language:\n\n**Alpha: Development**\n\n* **Things to Work With:**\n\t+ Work Products: Code, Automated Tests, Documentation\n\t+ Competencies: Development, Testing, Documentation\n* **Things to Do:**\n\t+ Activities: \n\t\t- Develop Code\n\t\t- Review Code\n\t\t- Debug Issues\n\t\t- Create Automated Tests\n\t\t- Optimize Performance\n\t+ Checklists:\n\t\t- Review code for efficiency and clarity\n\t\t- Ensure code meets requirements and standards\n\t\t- Debug issues and resolve defects\n\t\t- Create automated tests for new code\n\t\t- Optimize code for performance and scalability\n* **Competencies:**\n\t+ Development: Develop high-quality code that meets requirements and standards\n\t+ Testing: Create and execute automated tests to ensure code quality\n\t+ Documentation: Maintain clear and accurate documentation of code and development process\n\n**Alpha: Teamwork**\n\n* **Things to Work With:**\n\t+ Work Products: Code, Automated Tests, Documentation\n\t+ Competencies: Collaboration, Communication\n* **Things to Do:**\n\t+ Activities: \n\t\t- Collaborate on Design and Implementation\n\t\t- Review and Provide Feedback on Code\n\t\t- Participate in Team Meetings and Discussions\n\t+ Checklists:\n\t\t- Collaborate with team members to design and implement features\n\t\t- Review and provide feedback on code to ensure quality and clarity\n\t\t- Participate in team meetings and discussions to stay informed and aligned\n* **Competencies:**\n\t+ Collaboration: Work effectively with team members to achieve common goals\n\t+ Communication: Communicate clearly and effectively with team members and stakeholders"}

We call it the New Year’s Eve Retrospective. Not only is it a lot of fun, but it also helps pass the time until midnight (especially helpful with children). The New Year’s Eve Retrospective goes like this: To start, we all sit down together and look at some photos and watch some short videos that we took during the year. I’ve prepared a USB stick with the photos and videos beforehand. This phase of our retrospective is always loads of fun and results in a lot of laughter.\nAfter this review, we have a look at our measures and hypotheses from the year. This is important because it is the only way we can determine whether or not the resolutions we made last year had the desired effect. If they didn’t, we can decide whether the subject is still relevant and choose a new measure. After reviewing our hypotheses, we start to recollect all the things about the last year that have been particularly memorable. We use three categories:\n- What did I like this year?\n- What I did not like at all this year (or what made me angry)?\n- Thank you\nThe first category is for all of those things that were fun or made us happy; for example, our family holiday in a kyrgyz yurt. The second category includes all the negative events. These are things like “socks everywhere” or “annoying parents.” The third category simply serves to say “thank you” to your wife or mom, to the children or siblings, and so on. Connecting your gratitude to a specific case is always important. For example, “Thanks for letting me play with your Skylander toys” or “Thank you for making me a snack every morning.”\n‘It is then time to gain knowledge and insights. Each family member is allowed to choose a topic that he or she finds particularly important, and these topics are discussed in turn. The goal of these discussions is to find the underlying causes for the topic. At the moment, we’re finding the 5-Why question method very valuable here\n**5-Why Method**\nThis method starts with the question: “why is x happening?” or “why does x always happen?” The answer serves as the basis for the next “why” question. You then repeat the process, digging deeper and deeper until, hopefully, you’ve found the real cause. We make sure to write this cause on a piece of paper because it is the foundation of the next phase. The 5- Why method is around 100 years old and was created by Sakichi Toyota [ 5], the founder of Toyota, to get to the bottom of production problems and so prevent them from re-occurring.\nThe next step is to use the causes we’ve found to create concrete, measurable resolutions for next year. To this end, we have a short brainstorming session to collect ideas about our topics. You wouldn’t believe the ideas children can come up with, even for the topics closer to their parents’ hearts. Everyone presents his or her ideas for each topic, and we choose the most promising idea. We make our choice by sticking colored dots up next to the ideas on the paper. This technique is called “Dot Voting.” Each of us has three sticky dots, which we can put wherever we like. Once we’ve finished, we place the newly chosen measures in a prominent place: our family corkboard in the hall, which is our highly visual to-do list. There is nothing worse than results that are not visible after the retrospective. Our board helps us to keep an eye on our new measures and ensure that we actually implement them. Importantly, we also link each measure to a testable hypothesis that we can review in the next retrospective.\nOf course, a retrospective also needs a worthy ending. ’ In this case, the choice is easy: the New Year’s Eve fireworks.","# Restrospective Essence cards - Activities  \nTitle: Hold a Retrospective\nDescription: The whole team meets regularly to reflect on its way of working.

First articulated by Norman Kerth in his book, Project Retrospectives: A Handbook for Team Reviews [ 1], the Prime Directive is designed to set the stage for the retrospective:\nRegardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time,\ntheir skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand.\nThis principle is read aloud at the beginning of a retrospective, precisely in this wording.\nThe idea is to make it clear to everyone that we are all human and make mistakes. The principle also points out that we shouldn’t assume that things have been done badly deliberately.\n**Practical Tip**\nYou don’t need to read out the Prime Directive at every retrospective. In later retrospectives, simply reminding people of it is enough.\nMany retrospective facilitators swear by the Prime Directive. They feel that retrospectives that don’t start with this fundamental principle are less effective and therefore less useful. Pat Kua writes [Kua 2012] that this is related to the Pygmalion [ 11] or Rosenthal effect, or what is commonly known as “ ‘a self-fulfilling prophecy.’ ”\nThe effect of a teacher’s preconceptions about his students might be an example of the Rosenthal effect. The idea is that a teacher’s positive preconception about a student (‘that student is a high achiever’) will affect the teacher’s behavior in such a way as to create confirmation of his expectations. What happens is that the teacher subtly transmits his preconception to the student through, for example, more one-to-one attention, more time given for response, frequency and strength of praise or blame, or high-performance requirements. This is an unconscious rather than deliberate course of action.\nIn essence, the theory is that someone who is treated as having certain characteristics will manifest them. In fact, Rosenthal’s results were repeatedly called into question and could only be reproduced in 40 percent of cases [ 11].\nI personally believe that the success of a retrospective depends not on the careful reading out of the Prime Directive, but rather upon the values that it describes. I have carried out many successful retrospectives during which I did not explicitly mention the Prime Directive. I’m not saying that reading the\nprinciple isn’t a good thing; in new teams or established teams that are about to experience their first retrospective, this ritual can have a very positive, if not measurable, effect. In my experience, however, you lose that positive effect if you read out the directive at every retrospective. Repetition does to the directive what frequent flying does to pre-flight safety briefings. The first time you fly, you pay close attention. However, with prolonged exposure, you pay less and less attention until, in the end, you hardly notice it’s happening.\nA positive attitude is essential for a successful retrospective, but I believe there are many ways to achieve that attitude and the Prime Directive is only one (and one that is certainly no guarantee of success).\nThere is also an alternative prime directive that is somewhat longer but may work better for some teams [ 12]. I personally like the fact that it is written in the first person and is thus more appealing:\nSome days are better than others. Some days I’m in the “flow” state, doing awesome work. Some days I come to the end of a day and realized I’ve wasted a lot of time, made mistakes that I should have foreseen, or wish I could have done something differently.\nRegardless, those days have happened and our purpose here is to find out:\nWhat can we learn from our past actions and thinking that will inform and guide our future actions and thinking so that we can do a little better?\nHow can we change our environment (“the system”) so that it’s easier for us to do awesome work and less likely for us for us to waste time and make mistakes?\nLike the original Prime Directive, this version describes the goal of a retrospective and articulates the underlying principles.

The agile open source environment\nWe gathered and analyzed data produced by students dur- ing the development of the project work for the Software Engineering course.

The implementation of CAS aims to provide an autonomous environment which can be deployed on a private server or a hybrid cloud, and extended with additional open source tools, while keeping complete control over the data and source code stored within. The CAS structure is composed of a server, which is a basic set of shared services, and some clients, which are used by developers to interact with the services, as shown in Fig.2.\nA CAS Client is installed by the developer along with an IDE of their choice, among the supported ones, and consists of two distinct parts:\n- A plug-in for the chosen IDE to monitor the development and record the metrics which will be sent to the logger service hosted on the CAS server.\n- A Browser capable of interfacing with the logger dash- board on the server in order to retrieve and show all the metrics with graphs.\n1) CAS Server: All the CAS services are open source and each one of them has a utility in contributing to different activities in the agile development process\n2) CAS-Logger and CAS-Dashboard: CAS-Loggeris a self tracking service that allows each user to view personal statis- tics generated by the actions performed on an IDE, equipped with a plugin that connects to a CAS service repository.

INTRODUCTION\nAgile methodologies are widely used in the software industry, where they are applied using a variety of processes and best practices. Agile methods and practices can also help students develop valuable soft skills such as communication, teamwork, and adaptability. Practicing agile, they should learn how to work effectively with a product owner and other developers, respond to changing requirements, and aiming at continuously improving their work processes. Although there are several agile methods, two are especially outstanding: Scrum [21] and Extreme Programming [3]. The former is the most popular, be- cause it enforces the major Agile principles of iterative, value- based, incremental delivery by frequently gathering customer feedback and embracing requirements change. The latter is also well known, as it introduced a set of agile best practices that can be easily be applied and exploited by students, such as pair programming, the collective property of code, requirements as user stories, etc. An important value fostered by the agile vision is that the process is less important than individuals and interactions. We interpret this value suggesting the students that they can choose the best practices to use\nduring the development. Planning and implementing their own Agile software process can also help students develop a sense of ownership and responsibility over their work. They will have a better understanding of what is expected of them, and they will be more motivated to achieve their goals. Overall, learning how to plan their own Agile software process and pick Agile best practices can be a valuable learning experience for students, preparing them for successful careers in software development and helping them develop important skills for any profession.\nIn this paper we report on our experiences with training to agile vision and selection of agile best practices our Computer science students in a software engineering class. We adopt the Essence approach [12] that is based on a visual language able to capture combinations of agile practices and the state of their enactment inside a development process. Essence is formally an international standard issued by OMG [18].\nLearning how to plan their own Agile software process and choose which best practices apply can help students become more effective and efﬁcient in their software development work. They will be able to break down complex projects into smaller, more manageable tasks and work collaboratively with their team members to complete these tasks in a timely manner. We use a team building game to help the students to select their role in a Scrum-like team. Then we ask them to use a number of state-of-the art open source tools, like Taiga, GitLab, and SonarQube, to help them during the development and to collect data useful for the analysis we will report in this paper. We also suggest them to follow the Essence approach to process enactment and retrospective analysis. Concerning the evaluation of this experience, we have developed a maturity model to analyze how student teams perform their teamwork. We observed more than one hundred students divided in teams averaging ﬁve members each.\nSpeciﬁcally, we observed 136 students (57 in 2021 and 79 in 2022) divided in 27 teams (11 in 2021 and 16 in 2022) with an average of 5 components each (three teams had six components and two teams had four).\nThe project consisted in creating a Twitter client enriched with\na dashboard with several ﬁltering and visual analytics features.\nThe teamwork was organized following a Scrum-like ap- proach: each team had to work for at least three 3-week-sprints using CAS services and then write a ﬁnal report to summarize the development process. Each student had then to complete an individual questionnaire to evaluate the experience.\nWe collected several data. The main data sources were the ﬁnal reports, the individual questionnaires and, within the CAS environment, Gitlab, Taiga, and SonarQube. The ﬁnal reports were a fundamental source of data since, in addition to containing all mandatory information, most teams included additional elements regarding their own process. Tools were shared with the instructors. Gitlab was used to analyze the structure of the teams’ repositories and obtain data regarding the frequency of commits and the tests performed. Taiga was used by the teams to manage their sprints and their retrospectives (conducted using Essence cards); the instructors, as Product Owners, could see the progresses on the product and its documentation. SonarQube was used for extracting product quality data and technical debt data.\nThis paper has the following structure: Section II presents some related works; Section III overviews the approach we fol- lowed, describing the preliminary activities for team building, the product to be built by the teams, the process enacted, and the open source tools which were used. Section IV presents the results of the analysis of the data we collected; Section V discusses these results; ﬁnally, Section VI presents our conclusions and the work we are planning now.","# Essence Seminar - Essence: Software Engineering Essentialized  \n## Essence on OMG web site\nSuccessful software-development teams need to strike a balance between quickly\ndelivering working software systems, satisfying stakeholders, and addressing risks. Their challenges are further compounded as they strive to improve and introduce new\nideas and ways of working.\nEssence was the very first step on a journey to revolutionize software engineering. A\ncommon ground was needed to build the future upon. The Essence™ standard was created in 2014 by the SEMAT and OMG to provide a universalrianguuge for defining methods and practices common to all software engineering.\nEssence intuitively describes the essential elements of any software development and\nhelps teams understand where they are, what's missing or what needs to be addressed. Essence is method-agnostic and unites the myriad of disconnected,\nconflicting, costly, contradictory and transitory methods and practices that exist in most large organizations.  \n## Essence on Semat Web site  \n## Agenda of this Seminar\nSoftware Engineering concepts are given for granted\n- Introduction to Essence\n- The Basics of Software Engineering\n- The EssenceLanguage\n- The EssenceKernel\n- Conclusions: Reflections on Essence Goals and Theory of Software Engineering\n- Appendix: A summary of EssenceConcepts and Elements"],"answer":"Here's the translation of the practice into the Essence language:\n\n**Alpha: System Design**\n\n* **Things to Work With:**\n\t+ Work Products: System Architecture, APIs, Deployment Plans\n\t+ Competencies: System Design, API Development, Cloud Deployment\n* **Things to Do:**\n\t+ Activities: \n\t\t- Design Independent Services\n\t\t- Define Clear APIs for Communication\n\t\t- Ensure Scalability and Maintainability\n\t\t- Deploy and Monitor Services Separately\n\t\t- Manage Data Consistency\n\t\t- Handle Failures Gracefully\n\t+ Checklists:\n\t\t- Identify system requirements\n\t\t- Design services and APIs\n\t\t- Plan deployment and monitoring\n\t\t- Ensure scalability and maintainability\n\t\t- Manage data consistency\n\t\t- Handle failures\n* **Competencies:**\n\t+ System Design: Design and implement independent services\n\t+ API Development: Define clear APIs for communication\n\t+ Cloud Deployment: Deploy and monitor services separately\n\t+ Debugging: Handle failures gracefully\n\n**Patterns:**\n\n* **Service-Oriented Architecture:** Design and implement independent services\n* **API-First Development:** Define clear APIs for communication\n* **Cloud-Native Deployment:** Deploy and monitor services separately\n\n**Essence Cards:**\n\n* **Design Independent Services:** The system is composed of independent services, each with its own API.\n* **Define Clear APIs:** The APIs are well-defined and documented, making it easy for services to communicate with each other.\n* **Ensure Scalability and Maintainability:** The system is designed to scale and maintain, with a focus on flexibility and reliability."}
