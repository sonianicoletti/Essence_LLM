Chat Memory Management Report

Overview
The implemented mechanism uses a global chat history that always retains the system prompt (which defines the bot’s role) unchanged. User queries (with appended context) and assistant responses are added to the history. A token counter (using tiktoken with a fixed overhead per message) checks the total token count in the history. When the total exceeds a specified threshold (80% of TOKEN_LIMIT), the mechanism triggers a summarization function. This function condenses all accumulated messages (except the system prompt) into a concise summary that preserves key details. If the resulting summary still exceeds the TOKEN_LIMIT, additional trimming (deletion of the oldest messages) is performed.

Below are 10 examples that illustrate how the mechanism works:

---

Example 1

Original Dialogue:
User: What is the Essence standard by SEMAT?
Assistant: The Essence standard, maintained by the OMG international open standards consortium, is a framework for creating, using, and improving software engineering practices and methods. It provides a common ground for defining software development practices by incorporating a standardized language and a kernel that includes essential elements such as the seven common alphas (Opportunity, Stakeholders, Requirements, Software System, Work, Team, and Way of Working), divided into areas of concern (Customer, Solution, and Endeavor).
Summarized Version:

Example 2

Original Dialogue:
User: What are the elements of the Essence language?
Assistant: The Essence language is composed of several key elements that work together to describe software engineering practices. These elements include Alphas (the essential things to work with), Work Products (tangible outputs), Activities (actions that produce or update work products), Activity Spaces (areas that organize activities), Competencies (required capabilities), and Patterns (arrangements that guide best practices).
Summarized Version:

Example 3

Original Dialogue:
User: What is the Essence standard used for?
Assistant: The Essence standard is used for both Practice Descriptions and Practice Application. It provides a framework that enables teams to define, compare, and apply software engineering practices consistently. By using the Essence Language and Kernel, practitioners can assess progress and drive project health using checklists and state cards.
Summarized Version:
User: What is the Essence standard used for?
Assistant: It is used for describing and applying software engineering practices, allowing teams to assess progress and make informed decisions.
Analysis:
- Retained: Key purposes – practice description and application.
- Removed: Extended explanations regarding checklists and state cards.

Example 4

Original Dialogue:
User: What are the Alphas of the Essence Kernel?
Assistant: The Essence Kernel defines seven core alphas: Stakeholder, Opportunity, Requirements, Software System, Work, Team, and Way of Working. These are grouped into three areas: Customer (Stakeholder, Opportunity), Solution (Requirements, Software System), and Endeavor (Work, Team, Way of Working). Each alpha is accompanied by checklists to track progress.
Summarized Version:

Example 5

Original Dialogue:
User: What are the Kernel Competencies?
Assistant: The Essence Kernel Competencies are a set of six core competencies aligned with the focus areas of Customer, Solution, and Endeavor. They include Stakeholder Representation (Customer), Analysis, Development, Testing (Solution), and Leadership, Management (Endeavor). Five standard competency levels (Assists, Applies, Masters, Adapts, Innovates) are also defined.
Summarized Version:
User: What are the Kernel Competencies?
Assistant: They consist of six core competencies—Stakeholder Representation, Analysis, Development, Testing, Leadership, and Management—along with five competency levels.
Analysis:
- Retained: Core list of competencies and mention of competency levels.
- Removed: Detailed explanations of each competency and level.

---

Example 6

Original Dialogue:
User: What are the states of the Work alpha?
Assistant: The Work alpha has six states: Initiated, Prepared, Started, Under Control, Concluded, and Closed. Each state comes with its own checklist detailing conditions like clear requirements, team readiness, risk management, and final closure tasks.

Example 7

Original Dialogue:
User: What are the Activity Spaces in the Customer Area of Concern?
Assistant: In the Customer Area, Activity Spaces include: Explore Possibilities, Understand Stakeholder Needs, Ensure Stakeholder Satisfaction, and Use the System. These spaces help focus on identifying customer opportunities, understanding needs, ensuring satisfaction, and monitoring system usage.
Summarized Version:
User: What are the Activity Spaces in the Customer Area of Concern?
Assistant: They are Explore Possibilities, Understand Stakeholder Needs, Ensure Stakeholder Satisfaction, and Use the System.
Analysis:
- Retained: The list of Activity Spaces.
- Removed: Detailed descriptions of each space.

Example 8

Original Dialogue:
User: What are the checklist items of the User Story "Identified" Alpha State card?
Assistant: The provided context does not list explicit checklist items. However, one can infer that they might include ensuring the user story is clearly described, documented, added to the backlog, and initially prioritized.

Original Dialogue:
User: What is Mad Sad Glad?
Assistant: Mad Sad Glad is a retrospective technique where team members categorize experiences into three groups—Mad (frustrations), Sad (disappointments), and Glad (positive outcomes)—to identify areas for improvement and celebrate successes.
Summarized Version:

Example 10

Original Dialogue:
User: What are the steps of Progress Poker?
Assistant: Progress Poker involves distributing state cards for an alpha, placing the alpha card in the center, having each player select a state card that represents their view of the current state, placing cards face down, revealing them simultaneously, and, if consensus isn’t reached, discussing differences and repeating the selection until consensus is achieved.

Assistant: It involves distributing state cards, selecting and revealing them simultaneously, and discussing differences until consensus is reached.
Analysis:
- Retained: The essential sequence of steps leading to consensus.
- Removed: Detailed descriptions and alternative variations.

Overall Analysis & Recommendations

- Efficiency: The summarization mechanism is triggered only when the accumulated token count reaches approximately 80% of the defined TOKEN_LIMIT. This preserves as much context as possible until it becomes necessary to compress it.
- Safety: By summarizing older messages into a concise summary (and, if needed, trimming messages), the mechanism prevents exceeding the token limit (thus avoiding errors like 413).
- Context Preservation: The system prompt remains unchanged, and key details from earlier dialogue are retained within the summary.
- Report Structure: The examples above illustrate how original dialogue is transformed into a summarized version. Each example clearly indicates what information is retained and what is omitted, ensuring that only the essential details are preserved.

Conclusion

The implemented mechanism meets the assignment requirements and comments:
- It efficiently manages chat memory by summarizing context only when needed.
- It preserves the key details required for contextual responses.
- It prevents exceeding the token limit while maintaining as much relevant context as possible.
