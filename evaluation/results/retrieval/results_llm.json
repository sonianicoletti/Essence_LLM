      "# Essence Pocket Guide\nA quick introduction to Essence.\nEssence has alphas, work products, competencies, activities, patterns and resources.  \n## Introduction\nEssence is a standard for the creation, use and improvement of software engineering practices and methods, which is maintained and published by the OMG international open standards consortium.\nThe spirit of Essence is to concentrate on the essential information and to optimize both the technical and human aspects of engineering by providing super-lightweight practices, often distilled into a small handful of cards, that focus on outcomes and minimize production of documentation.\nAs an industry standard, Essence describes a language and a kernel for these engineering practices:\n• The Essence Language enables practices to be expressed in a simple and standard form that ensures that they can be easily shared, understood, and applied both independently and in combination with other Essence practices.\n• The Essence Kernel provides the common ground for defining these Essence practices. It includes the essential elements that are always central to every software engineering endeavor. The Kernel also helps practitioners compare practices and make informed decisions about which practices to adopt, and how to apply and adapt them."

      "# The Essence Kernel\nThe Essence kernel is the set of Essence elements that would always be found in all types of software system endeavours.\nFor instance, the element architecture was discussed as a kernel element.\n- The opinion was that while for many systems it is critical to identify an architecture there are many simpler systems where architecture is not an issue.\n- Since it is not common to all projects, architecture is not a concern that every endeavor has to face, it didn’t qualify as a kernel element.\nIn the following slides we will illustrate the elements that are part of Essence Kernel  \n## Areas of Concerns\nThe Essence kernel elements are organized around 3 areas of concerns, that we have already seen:\n- Customer: This area of concern contains everything to do with the actual use and exploitation of the software system to be produced.\n- Solution: This area of concern contains everything related to the specification and development of the software system.\n- Endeavor: This area of concern contains everything related to the development team and the way that they approach their work  \n## The Essence Kernel\nThe kernel elements are fundamentally of four kinds:\n1. The essential things to work with - the alphas\n2. The essential things to do - the activity spaces\n3. The essential capabilities needed - the competencies\n4. The essential arrangements of elements - the patterns.\n- Finding the right elements is crucial.\n- They must be universally acceptable, significant, relevant and guided by the notion that,\n“You have achieved perfection not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.”*",

      "# 3. ESSENCE KERNEL\nEssence kernel contains essential elements that should be addressed in every software engineering endeavor. The kernel elements have 3 categories: alphas, activity spaces and competencies [3]. As shown in Figure 2, there are 7 alphas (Figure 2A)—stakeholder, opportunity, requirements, software system, work, way of working and team—and 15 activity spaces (2B) and 6 competencies (2C). Alphas, activity spaces and competencies are grouped in 3 areas of concern: customer, solution and endeavor.\n## 3.1 Essence Alpha and State Checklist\nAlphas are manifested by work products. Each alpha has a set of states. As shown in Figure 3, the opportunity alpha may be in one of six states over the lifecycle of a software engineering endeavor. If, for example, Product Vision—a work product in Scrum practice—is mapped to the opportunity alpha, Product Vision is deemed to go through the states listed in Figure 3. Essence also provides a checklist for each alpha state as illustrated in Figure 3. Cards can be used to recall the kernel elements. Figure 3 shows two types of cards—alpha definition card and alpha state detail card. Note that the checklist in an alpha state detail card shows an abbreviated version of the full checklist specified in [3].\n## 3.2 Essence Activity Space and Goal State\nActivity spaces are realized by one or more activities in a practice. Each activity may create or update one or more work products. For example, the understand the requirements activity space could be viewed as being realized by the release planning activity when using Scrum practice. Release planning produces a product backlog (work product), and this could be viewed as a manifest of the requirements alpha.\nActivities within a given activity space in an area of concern changes the states of some alphas in the same area. Figure 4 shows, based on Essence 1.0 [3], the alpha states that should typically be achieved by each activity space. We will call them the goal states of an activity space. For instance, the goal states of the explore possibilities activity space include: stakeholder::recognized, opportunity::identified, opportunity::solution needed, and opportunity::value established. The goal states of an activity can be determined as a subset of the goal states of the activity spaces in which the activity is contained.\nWe can observe in Figure 4 that an activity space sometimes transforms an alpha to a new state over one or more intermediate states: e.g., the understand the requirements activity space transforms the requirements alpha from a null state to the coherent state through two intermediate states: conceived and bounded. When an activity space drives an alpha to go through multiple states, the checklist to verify achievement of the activity space’s goal states should cumulatively contain all the checkpoints corresponding to those multiple states. The activity space checklist to verify achievement of the entire goal states of an activity space is obtained by the union of the checklist for every alpha affected by the activity space.\nIt should be noted that the activity space-alpha state relationships suggested in Essence 1.0 [3] (and shown in Figure 4) should be regarded as just a guideline. They will need to be tailored to address specific project situations. The Essence specification itself will evolve over coming years. The systematic procedure presented in Section 4 for describing a practice based on the Essence kernel is, however, still valid independent of any change to the activity space-alpha state relationships and alpha state checklists."

      "# Essence Kernel Competencies  \nThe Essence Kernel defines six core Competencies that are the commonly needed for any software endeavor.  \nNote that, as with other aspects of the Essence Kernel, the set of Competencies described by the Kernel is the core, minimum set that is generally always expected to be required on any software development endeavor. Specialist Practices can extend this core minimum set by introducing their own additional Competencies as needed for particular types of endeavor to address specific types of challenge, such as Operations, Coaching, Database Administration or Hardware Design for example.  \n## Essence Kernel Competency Levels  \nThe Essence Kernel defines five standard Competency Levels that can be used across all Competencies as follows:  \nAssists - demonstrates a basic understanding of the concepts involved and can follow instructions\nApplies - able to apply the concepts in simple contexts by routinely applying the experience gained so far\nMasters - able to apply the concepts in most contexts and has the experience to work without supervision\nAdapts - able to apply judgment on when and how to apply the concepts to more complex contexts. Can make it possible for others to apply the concepts\nInnovates - a recognized expert, able to extend the concepts to new contexts and inspire others."

      "# Alpha State Card Game: Progress Poker\n## Object of Play\nTeam members may have different opinions on where they are, or where they need to go next. The idea behind Progress Poker is simple. Individual Alphas are presented for assessment. After a period of discussion, each participant chooses from his or her own deck the numbered card that represents his or her estimate of the state that the Alpha is currently in. All estimates are kept private until each participant has chosen a card. At that time, all estimates are revealed and discussion can begin again.\nUse this game to determine the state of any particular Alpha.\n## Variations\nThe game can also be played with only one set of cards:\n1) Lay the state cards for the Alpha under consideration out on the table, in order, in front of the players.\n2) Each player considers the set of states and identifies the state that they believe the Alpha to be in.\n3) The players then simultaneously raise their hands with the correct number of fingers raised to indicate the state they have selected. A closed fist is used to indicate the sixth state.\n4) If all players have selected the same state card then there is consensus.\n5) If the selected cards are different then the players with the least and most advanced states explain their reasoning.\n6) Repeat from 3 until consensus emerges\nOr without the cards at all. As for the previous variation but in this case each player has a copy of the Reference Guide to consult when identifying the appropriate state.\n## Number of Players\nAny, but typically teams of 3 to 9 will be the most effective.\n## Equipment Needed\n- Essential: 1 set of Alpha State Cards for each player\n- Optional: An Alpha State Card Reference Guide\n## Duration of Play\n2 – 10 minutes.\n## How to Play\n1. Each player is given a set of state cards for the Alpha under consideration.\n2. The Alpha card for the Alpha under consideration is placed in the center of the table.\n3. Each player selects the state card that he or she thinks best represents the current state of the Alpha.\n4. All members put their selected state card face down on the table.\n5. When all are ready, they turn the state card face up.\nIf all players have selected the same state card then there is consensus.\n7. If the selected cards are different then the players with the least and most advanced states explain their reasoning.\n8. Repeat from 3 until consensus emerges\nOptional step: @ state 6 then the players might want to consider the full checklists found in the Reference Guide.\n## Strategy\nProgress Poker is a good way to come to a consensus without spending too much time on any one topic. It allows, or forces, people to voice their opinions, thoughts and concerns. Pick the Alphas of concern to the group and focus on them. This game can be used in conjunction with “Chase the State” to determine the overall state of any software development effort.
