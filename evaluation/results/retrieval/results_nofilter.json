It includes the essential elements that are always central to every software engineering endeavor. The Kernel also helps practitioners compare practices and make informed decisions about which practices to adopt, and how to apply and adapt them.",

The essential things to work with - the alphas\n2. The essential things to do - the activity spaces\n3. The essential capabilities needed - the competencies\n4. The essential arrangements of elements - the patterns.\n- Finding the right elements is crucial.\n- They must be universally acceptable, significant, relevant and guided by the notion that,\n“You have achieved perfection not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.”*",

      "# 3. ESSENCE KERNEL\nEssence kernel contains essential elements that should be addressed in every software engineering endeavor. The kernel elements have 3 categories: alphas, activity spaces and competencies [3]. As shown in Figure 2, there are 7 alphas (Figure 2A)—stakeholder, opportunity, requirements, software system, work, way of working and team—and 15 activity spaces (2B) and 6 competencies (2C). Alphas, activity spaces and competencies are grouped in 3 areas of concern: customer, solution and endeavor.\n## 3.1 Essence Alpha and State Checklist\nAlphas are manifested by work products. Each alpha has a set of states. As shown in Figure 3, the opportunity alpha may be in one of six states over the lifecycle of a software engineering endeavor. If, for example, Product Vision—a work product in Scrum practice—is mapped to the opportunity alpha, Product Vision is deemed to go through the states listed in Figure 3. Essence also provides a checklist for each alpha state as illustrated in Figure 3. Cards can be used to recall the kernel elements. Figure 3 shows two types of cards—alpha definition card and alpha state detail card. Note that the checklist in an alpha state detail card shows an abbreviated version of the full checklist specified in [3].\n## 3.2 Essence Activity Space and Goal State\nActivity spaces are realized by one or more activities in a practice. Each activity may create or update one or more work products. For example, the understand the requirements activity space could be viewed as being realized by the release planning activity when using Scrum practice. Release planning produces a product backlog (work product), and this could be viewed as a manifest of the requirements alpha.\nActivities within a given activity space in an area of concern changes the states of some alphas in the same area. Figure 4 shows, based on Essence 1.0 [3], the alpha states that should typically be achieved by each activity space. We will call them the goal states of an activity space. For instance, the goal states of the explore possibilities activity space include: stakeholder::recognized, opportunity::identified, opportunity::solution needed, and opportunity::value established. The goal states of an activity can be determined as a subset of the goal states of the activity spaces in which the activity is contained.\nWe can observe in Figure 4 that an activity space sometimes transforms an alpha to a new state over one or more intermediate states: e.g., the understand the requirements activity space transforms the requirements alpha from a null state to the coherent state through two intermediate states: conceived and bounded. When an activity space drives an alpha to go through multiple states, the checklist to verify achievement of the activity space’s goal states should cumulatively contain all the checkpoints corresponding to those multiple states. The activity space checklist to verify achievement of the entire goal states of an activity space is obtained by the union of the checklist for every alpha affected by the activity space.\nIt should be noted that the activity space-alpha state relationships suggested in Essence 1.0 [3] (and shown in Figure 4) should be regarded as just a guideline. They will need to be tailored to address specific project situations. The Essence specification itself will evolve over coming years. The systematic procedure presented in Section 4 for describing a practice based on the Essence kernel is, however, still valid independent of any change to the activity space-alpha state relationships and alpha state checklists.",

Each player selects the state card that he or she thinks best represents the current state of the Alpha.\n4. All members put their selected state card face down on the table.\n5. When all are ready, they turn the state card face up.\nIf all players have selected the same state card then there is consensus.\n7. If the selected cards are different then the players with the least and most advanced states explain their reasoning.\n8. Repeat from 3 until consensus emerges\nOptional step: @ state 6 then the players might want to consider the full checklists found in the Reference Guide.\n## Strategy\nProgress Poker is a good way to come to a consensus without spending too much time on any one topic. It allows, or forces, people to voice their opinions, thoughts and concerns. Pick the Alphas of concern to the group and focus on them. This game can be used in conjunction with “Chase the State” to determine the overall state of any software development effort. Once the current state of an Alpha is known then the next state to be achieved is obvious.",
      "# Scenario description.\n- This is a generic and sequential description of the flow of events of a use case.\n- Describe the precondition (initial state of the system)\n- List the sequence of steps\n- Include interactions with actors and describe which entities are exchanged\n- Description must be clear, precise, and brief\nSearch for use cases:\nUseful questions:\n- What are the tasks of this actor?\n- Will the actor manage information in the system?\n- What Use Cases will create, modify, read this information?\n- Does the actor need to inform the system of sudden changes?\n- Does the actor need to be informed of certain situations?\n- Does the system support the business with correct behavior?\n- What Use Cases support and maintain the system?\n- Are all functional requirements covered by the Use Cases we found?",
      "# Where are we? (Pattern of Retrospective Practice)  \nA (serious) game to play during retrospectives.  \nSource: Agile Retrospective\nTags: Serious Games\nWorkshop Techniques  \n## Participants:\n- 7 +-2\n- A facilitator (who can also participate)  \n## Equipment:\n- Alpha State Cards\n- Large, flat work area  \n## Basic instructions of Where are we?:\n1. Lay out the cards for each Alpha in a row on the table with the first state on the left and the final state on the right\n2. Starting with the first state of the first Alpha, walkthrough the checklist and ask if the state has been achieved.\n3. If the state has been achieved move the card to the left. Continue until you reach a state that the team has not yet achieved, or you run out of states.\n4. If it is not clear which state one of the Alphas is in then a quick round of Progress Poker can be used to help reach consensus.\n5. Repeat for all Alphas.\n6. Consider the overall position of the cards:\n1. Are any Alphas lagging?\n2. What are the next states to be achieved.  \n## Description:\nA SEMAT game that helps a team to understand where they are and contrast this wit where they need to be. The game uses the SEMAT Alphas and Alpha State Card to:\n- Assess where the team is\n- Identify gaps between the current state and the desired state  \n## Use when:\n- You want to get a holistic, method independent view of where you are and identify areas for improvement\n- Duration – up to 30 minutes  \n## Applied to:\n- Any software development endeavor  \n## Applied By:\n- Retrospect  \n## Related To:\n- Progress Poker  \n## Resources:\n- Alpha State Cards\n- Alpha State Card Games: Chase the State\n- Essence Quick Reference Guide"
